# Self assessment of TWU-G 75



## Agile & Process Delivery: 

#### Object

Use lean/agile techniques to contribute to the analysis. Write a user story narrative. 

#### Feedback from others

From Fangzhou and Xueling: In the discussion of a series of stories in shipping Address, I put forward the idea of dividing stories according to different pages and gave the actual scheme. Technical help for partitioning stories.

#### Self assessment

I think I did a good job overall in this area. In the analysis, I can clarify my thoughts and give my own contribution.

## Architecture: 

#### Object

Follow architectural patterns in the existing application design Follow existing API design patterns in an application 

#### Feedback from others

From Jame and Iggy: In the process of pair with them, they thought  I was clear at the design of the existing architecture pattern and could follow the existing design to develop new functions. They thought they were very clear on the procedure with me.

#### Self assessment

I think I don't have many problems with Architecture myself. However, due to the lack of enough practice, there will still be confusion in specific practice, and more practice is needed to exercise themselves.

## Built - Quality In: 

#### Object

Choose different levels of tests. Apply the red-green-refactor cycle. Follow TDD with unit tests. Follow the 'check-in dance' steps during development. Separate merges using feature toggles.

#### Feedback from others

From Qian: During the session exercise, I was in such a rush to implement so many features that I forgot to follow TDD. And not familiar with how to write various tests. During the session exercise, I was in such a rush to implement so many features that I forgot to follow TDD. And not familiar with how to write various tests. This led me to write code in an aimless and slow way.

From Askhat: In mob-session, I always stick to the red-green-refactoring cycle. Remind others to follow TDD. Keep the team practicing TDD.

From Menghan:  In the process of programming with me, I always adhere to the practice of TDD, but the speed of writing tests is relatively slow. We were doing things the right way, but it was a little inefficient because we weren't familiar with them.

#### Self assessment

I think I still have a lot to do in this area, such as developing TDD habits, more practice.



## Built- Security In: 

#### Object

Identify the risks of insecure applications Find sources of information on common security vulnerabilities 

#### Feedback from others

From Iggy: In pair, when we need to call the back-end interface, I find that the Shipping Address and Order already have circular dependencies. This was then communicated to the relevant development. This prevents more serious problems later on.

From Qian: 

#### Self assessment

I think I need to have more security awareness in this aspect and master more means to prevent various security problems.



## Consulting: 

#### Object

Object: Adapt presentation to the technical level of the audience Work in a team of people with varying opinions and participate in decision making.

#### Feedback from others

From Yuling and Jing: In my Pecha kucha, My Pecha Kucha is very attractive to her and easy to understand. Got her interested in cryptography.

From Xueling and Fangzhou: During a team decision, she asked me about the difference between the front end and the back end, and I explained the difference between the front end and the back end. She thinks it helps her understand business processes.

From Lanxi: In the fourth week, after I gained a new understanding of the previous story, I discussed with her the determination of the story. We all have a new understanding of how stories are divided.

#### Self assessment

I think I can effectively communicate with BA from a technical point of view and give suggestions. But I think my performance in Consulting session is not very good. I should also learn to deal with more changeable situations under pressure.

## Cultivation: 

#### Object

Explain the value of feedback and provide feedback using SBI (Situation Behaviour Impact) structure 

#### Feedback from others

From Jinfan: At the beginning of the first week, I found her struggling to express herself in English and encouraged her to speak more in the session. This helped her to feel confident in her performance in a team.

From Marzia: We will have face-to-face feedback every two weeks, and we will give each other feedback. I will also evaluate the action after the last feedback. This makes our actions much easier to implement.

#### Self assessment

I think I'm used to using SBI to give feedback to others. In addition, SBI will be referred to for review and improvement when receiving feedback.

## Continuous Delivery:

#### Object

Map the path to production of a basic project Follow instructions for deploying different types of artifacts into an environment. 

#### Feedback from others

From Jinfan: In a deployment project, I paid close attention to the deployment of the project and helped her answer some deployment questions, which was helpful for her to get familiar with the deployment.

From Jame: I explained the deployment process to him before we finished Stroy and started deskCheck. It also explains what phase each deployment should take place in. It made him more familiar with deployment.

#### Self assessment

I think I did a good job in this part.

## Software Development: 

#### Object

Describe the structure of a basic web service application.  Edit the application logic across all layers. Identify common coding problems.  Explain the importance of clean code.  Refactor basic code rules . Apply common estimation techniques (T-shirt sizes, fibonacci) Follow existing patterns, making changes to all layers of a front end component. 

#### Feedback from others

From Qian: When I made a page story, MY purpose was not clear enough, and I wrote the test too slowly. I needed to become more familiar with the back end and front end testing.

From Marzia: In a pair, I was not familiar with the various processes and tools of the front-end page. I was unable to give her more effective advice while she was programming.

From Thana and  Iggy: After the pair and session, they thought THAT I was familiar with the back-end process and could keep my independent thinking and give constructive suggestions. Helps the team make decisions. 

From Xueling, Lanxi and Fangzhou: In pair programming, there was a time when other developers said that a feature was difficult to implement when they wanted ba to change. I said I could implement the functionality. This allows them to avoid extra work.

#### Self assessment

This is where I think I need to improve the most. First I need to learn more about the front end. Secondly I need more code practices.

## Technology Alignment: 

#### Object

Identify where collaboration between technology and product teams add value.

#### Feedback from others

From Alicia: In Kick Off, I provide a lot of useful information from a technical perspective. This makes everyone understand the story better.

From Xiaoyun: After a leave, I did not timely communicate with other developers and XD. And modified the tape by himself. This caused some trouble in the follow-up work.

#### Self assessment

This is also a part where I need to refocus, where I need to think more in terms of value. I also need to constantly reflect on the value of my actions.
